The Polymer community is full of bright, thoughtful, helpful, supportive people - it's on all of us to keep it this way! Google and the Polymer team want to help foster and support this, and we take any breaches of mutual respect very seriously. Below is the community code of conduct, which applies to our Github repos and organizations, mailing lists, Slack channels, G+ community, and any other Polymer-supported communication group.


### Be excellent to each other.

Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.

### Speak up if you see or hear something.

Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

### Practice saying "Yes and" to each other.

Build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.

### We have a ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:

* Stalking/following
* Harassing comments
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of threads, channels, lists, etc.
* Offensive comments
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention

#### In relation to, but not limited to:

* Neurodiversity
* Race
* Color
* National origin
* Gender
* Gender identity
* Gender presentation
* Sexual orientation
* Age
* Body size
* Differing abilities
* Appearance
* Religion
* Pregnancy

We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that makes you or others feel uncomfortable by emailing community@polymer-project.org.

Any person communicating in a disorderly manner, engaging in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, or otherwise failing to comply with this policy may be removed from any Google-supported channel or permanently banned (including to future Google communities) at any time in Google’s sole discretion. 

### ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY

Google and the Polymer team are dedicated to supporting a harassment-free and inclusive community for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, differing abilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Polymer-related community. Google and the Polymer team take these violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately. All community members must abide by our anti-harassment policy.

### CONDUCT POLICY

Google and the Polymer team reserve the right to remove or ban any person from a Polymer-supported community (and potentially all future Google-supported communities) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes but is not limited to community members behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with the terms and conditions herein.
