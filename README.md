# CTZN (pronounced "Citizen")

An open social network built on the [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org) data mesh.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Software

CTZN is still in development! If you decide to run a server or build against the protocol, beware that breaking changes may occur and won't always be communicated ahead of time. We will create a stability process once CTZN reaches beta.
