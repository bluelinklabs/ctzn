# CTZN (pronounced "Citizen")

A decentralized social network with a strong focus on building communities.

**Features**

- Status feeds with 256 character limits but the ability to post "extended text" with no limit (shows on expand).
- Social following and moderated communities.
- Threaded comments.
- Decentralized hosting (anybody can create a server, and data syncs using the [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org)).

Read the [initial design document](./docs/design.md) to learn more about the architecture.

## ⚠️ Alpha Software

CTZN is still in development! If you decide to run a server or build against the protocol, beware that breaking changes may occur and won't always be communicated ahead of time. We will create a stability process once CTZN reaches beta.
